  tinc.connect_to:
    description: Specifies which other tinc daemon to connect to on startup
  tinc.decrement_ttl:
    description: When enabled, tinc will decrement the Time To Live field in IPv4 packets, or the Hop Limit field in IPv6 packets, before forwarding a received packet to the virtual network device or to another node, and will drop packets that have a TTL value of zero, in which case it will send an ICMP Time Exceeded packet back

    description: The type of the virtual network device
    default: tap
  tinc.direct_only:
    description: When this option is enabled, packets that cannot be sent directly to the destination node, but which would have to be forwarded by an intermediate node, are dropped instead
    default: no

    description: This option selects the way indirect packets are forwarded
    default: off
  tinc.fw_mark:
    description: When set to a non-zero value, all TCP and UDP sockets created by tinc will use the given value as the firewall mark
